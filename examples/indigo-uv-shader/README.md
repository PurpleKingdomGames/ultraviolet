# Indigo + Ultraviolet Example

> Warning: Ultraviolet has not yet been released, so to run these examples you will first need to run `sbt localPublish` (that isn't a typo!) in the main project directory.

This is a simple example of using an Ultraviolet generated shader inside Indigo.

## Running the example

Having checked out the repo and arrived in this example's directory in your terminal, simply run: `sbt runGame`

## Information

> Note that this is *NOT* the currently released version of Indigo.

This is a demo of the new `UltravioletShader`s that can be written directly rather than going via the old shader system.

The difference is that the old system uses a plain old GLSL template, where as these shaders are 100% generated by Ultraviolet.
